\section{Introduction}
\section{Posterior Predictive Checking}
All models are wrong. What we would like to know is what aspects of the model don't fit the data. If our models are  for the SPIRE maps are reasonable, the observed SPIRE maps should look plausible under the posterior predictive distribution. To asses the model fits provided by XID+, we compare the predictive distribution $\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{rep}}$ to the observed data $\mathbf{y}$. Unlike frequentist statistics, posterior predictive checking takes into account the uncertainty associated with the estimated parameters of the model. As posterior predictive checks involve a double use of the data, usage should be limited to measuring discrepancy to study model adequacy and not model comparison or inference (Meng 1994).

Discrepency between model and data is measured via a test quantity or discrepancy measure, $T(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{\Theta})$,  a scaler summary of all parameters and data. A test statistic  only depends on data. In Bayesian context, test statistics can be generalised to allow dependence on model parameters under posterior distribution.

\subsection{Tail area probabilities (or p-value)} 
Classical p-value for the test statistic $T(\mathbf{y})$ is
\begin{equation}
p_{C} = \Pr(T(\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{rep}})\le T(\mathbf{y})|\mathbf{\Theta})
\end{equation}
where $\Theta$ is fixed. Test statistics represent a summary measure of discrepancy between observed data and what would be expected under a model with a particular value of $\mathbf{Theta}$ such as the maximum likelihood value. 

Possible test statistics for SPIRE maps include:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{y})$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graphical posterior predictive checks}
Basic idea is to display data alongside simulated data and look for systematic discrepancies. This could include:
\begin{itemize}
\item direct display of data i.e. map and simulated maps. as in BDA, ordering of pixels could be important (though is the case for maps?)
\item display of data summaries (i.e. histogram of pixel flux densities) or parameter inferences (I don't understand the example in BDA for how parameter inferences can help).
\item display of residuals, though they are in Bayesian in this context as they include uncertainty in parameters. Histogram of residuals might also be useful.
\end{itemize}
