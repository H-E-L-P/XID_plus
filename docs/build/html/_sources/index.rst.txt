XID+, The Probabilistic De-blender for confusion dominated maps
=================================================================

XID+ is a core tool arising from the `Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) <http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk>`_. For
more information on XID+, have a look at `Hurley et al. 2017 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1606.05770>`_.

It is being actively developed in a public repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/H-E-L-P/XID_plus>`_ so if you have any trouble, open an issue there.
